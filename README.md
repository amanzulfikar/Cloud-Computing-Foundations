# Cloud Foundation Projects

Introduction to AWS IAM (Project 1)- Explored pre-created IAM Users & Groups. Inspected IAM policies as applied to the pre-created groups. Followed a real-world scenario, and added users to groups with specific capabilities enabled. Located and used the IAM sign-in URL. Experimented with the effects of policies on service access.

Building VPC and Launching a Web Server (Project 2)- Created a VPC, and subnets, configured a security group, and launched an EC2 instance into the VPC.

Intro to EC2 instances (Project 3)- Launched a web server with termination protection enabled, monitored the EC2 instance, modified the security group that the web server was using to allow HTTP access. Resized the EC2 instance to scale and enabled stop protections, explored EC2 limits, tested stop protection, and stopped the EC2 instance. 

Working with EBS (Project 4)- Created an Amazon EBS volume, attached and mounted the volume to an EC2 instance, created a snapshot of the volume, created a new volume from the snapshot, and attached and mounted the new volume to the EC2 instance. 

Build a Database Database server (Project 5)- Launched an RDS DB instance with high availability. Configured the database instance to permit connections from the web server. Opened a web application and interacted with the database. 

Scale & Load your Architecture (Project 6)- Created an AMI from a running instance, a load balancer, a launch template, and an auto scaling group. Automatically scaled new instances and Amazon CloudWatch alarms monitored the performance of the infrastructure.
